# Predictive Customer Churn Analysis using Random Forest Classifier
This repository presents a comprehensive guide on predicting customer churn for a gas company using a Random Forest Classifier. Tailored for data scientists, analysts, and business professionals, the insights derived from this analysis offer actionable strategies to mitigate customer churn and enhance overall customer retention.

# Introduction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn through the application of a Random Forest Classifier. Leveraging transactional data, the analysis encompasses a range of preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and visualization techniques to uncover patterns indicative of potential customer attrition.

# Importance
Anticipating customer churn is crucial for businesses, particularly in service industries like gas utilities. This analysis aids in understanding factors influencing customer churn, such as their price sensitivities, enabling companies to implement targeted retention strategies. The insights gained can inform personalized customer engagement, reduce churn rates, and improve the overall customer experience.

# Dependencies
To replicate the analysis, the following packages are required: \
pandas \
numpy \
seaborn \
matplotlib \
scikit-learn

# Data Preprocessing
Removal of Duplicates: Ensuring accuracy by eliminating duplicate entries in the transactional data.
Imputation of Null Values: Addressing missing data to maintain the integrity of the dataset.
Creation of Predictive Variables: Introduction of new features with significant predictive power.
Handling Date Information: Formatting date information for consistency and facilitating time-based analysis.
Visualizations: Utilization of seaborn and matplotlib for insightful visualizations, aiding in the identification of patterns and trends.

# Model
The RandomForestClassifier is imported from scikit-learn's ensemble and initiated.\
The model is trained using optimal parameters determined by GridSearch Cross-Validation.\
Determined the contribution of each feature to the predictive model.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test set by computing the F1 score, which is a measure of the balance between precision and recall. The F1 score is calculated using the f1_score function from the scikit-learn library. A confusion matrix is also created to visualize the performance of the model.

# Usage
To execute the code successfully, ensure the required dependencies are installed. Input the dataset following the specified preprocessing steps. Run the script to obtain the model's predictions and evaluate the F1 score for model performance.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project applies a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn in a gas company, shedding light on potential areas for proactive customer retention strategies. The model exhibits a moderate performance, providing a foundation for further refinement and enhancement. Future iterations could explore feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and additional data sources to improve predictive accuracy and strengthen the model's efficacy in identifying and mitigating customer churn. This endeavor marks a crucial step toward data-driven decision-making, offering valuable insights for businesses seeking to optimize customer retention efforts.
